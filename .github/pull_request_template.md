## Content

If applicable, attach a receipt to this PR (or leave it in a comment) and optionally describe the transaction.

### Formatting

Only submit one (1) file in csv format with an item and its price on each row, as follows:

```csv
item, 5.23
another item, 1.22
```

### Things to keep in mind:

- it's easiest if you enable auto-merge when creating the PR
- remember to assign reviewers to your PR to get it merged
- only underscores ('\_'), dashes ('-'), periods ('.'), and alphanumeric ([a-zA-Z]) allowed in filenames
